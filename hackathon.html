                    <p class="project-description-text">
                        The Wellesley Hackathon (WHACK) is an annual hackathon event hosted at Wellesley where undergrads from all across Boston come together to build things they could only dream of! My role on the Web Development Team of the organizing committee was to help develop a site where students could gain vital information for all things WHACK. My job was to help the hackers hack as best as they can, providing links for any technical educational resources, the schedule of events, and contact information for mentors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a Web Development Team Member, I wanted to serve as the first source of creative inspiration, turning the beautiful branding and designs from the D&M team into a tangible interface that the 100+ hackers could refer to in need. I believe one of the best feelings in the world is seeing people let their imaginations run wild, and helping those dreams become realized. Being a part of WHACK let me do that.

                <div class="project-description-container">
                    <h2 class="project-description-subtitle">Process:</h2>
                    <div class="project-description-text">
                        <p>During the first few weeks of the project, once we received the initial Figma prototype from the Design and Marketing team, the team got to implementing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>After an initial meeting, the team lead and I decided to implement the design in a one-page website structure, using Bootstrap as a CSS framework. I was tasked with collecting hackathon websites we could use as references, and to analyze what components of those web pages worked well and what didn't.
                        After analyzing five reference hackathon sites, I noticed they shared these four traits.</p>
                        <br>
                        <ol id="hackathon-list">
                            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Interactive/moving graphics</li>
                            <li style="font-weight:bold;">FAQ's in dropdown table format</li>
                            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Live countdown</li>
                            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Navigation bar linking to page sections</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            These traits lended a more <strong>informative, accessible, engaging, and clean </strong>web page, and so we made sure to include these 4 features in our build. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Using Major League Hacking guidelines, the team lead and I met 2-3x a week to pair program the features of the website. As the junior member of the team, I relied on the team leads feedback to improve the efficiency and clarity of my code. We also iterated our code based on the feedback of the D&M team, if at times there were designs that weren’t feasible to implement or that we need more clarification on. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In my freetime I studied the Bootstrap documentation, to better understand the capabilities of the framework, like its flexibility in styling tables or buttons, and how I can maximize its usefulness for WHACK webpage.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Most of our work was finished by the end of the summer. The rest of the time consisted largely of updating information as the Day-Of details cemented (and quietly appreciating the beautiful webpage we'd built).
                            At the end of the project, I was stunned at how quickly 6 months had passed by. In that span of time, I was not only a more efficient web developer, but an avid Bootstrap enthusiast, an advocate for detailed documentation, and a new student of responsive design.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My time as a web developer for the 2023 Wellesley Hackathon was the first leap in my journey as a front-end engineer. So, big shout out to Anna Zhou for leading me through the many iterations, and introducing me to the wonderful world of CSS frameworks.
