                    <h2 class="project-description-subtitle">Purpose:</h2>
                    <div class="project-description-text">
                        <p>As a generative A.I and curriculum researcher at the M.I.T Sloan School of Business, my role was to determine the ways in which new AI technologies could be applied in higher education, for both professors and students. While my main responsibility was to collect use cases for generative AI, I took on a separate 20% project.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This project was aimed at analyzing the performance of emerging A.I content detectors, technologies promising to differentiate between human-written and A.I generated text content with high levels of accuracy. After multiple news reports of false detector-based plagiarism accusations for high school and college students, I was intrigued at how reliable these detectors really were. Especially due to the speed at which people were adopting chatGPT, I knew it would become a pressing issue.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Inspired by investigative data journalism platforms like The Pudding and Propublica and the stunning, informative work they do, I set out to analyze accuracy of three popular A.I Content Detectors when faced with different excerpts of text, and to present my work in a visual data essay.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="project-description-container">
                    <h2 class="project-description-subtitle">Process:</h2>
                    <div class="project-description-text">
                        <p>This process of this research project was split into multiple stages, the first of which was: </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Literature Review:</h3>
                        <p>If my findings were going to respond to the false accusations of plagiarism across the country, I first needed to investigate the extent of the accusations. Most importantly, what detectors were being used and for what purposes. I also needed to understand how genAI was being used in classrooms at that moment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I consulted articles from the New York Times, Chronicle of Higher Education, the Washington Post, from early A.I adopter educators like Professor Ethan Mollick from UPenn, and research from Stanford University. I even stumbled upon a class at Boston University who self-established a policy for A.I usage in their classroom. </p>
                        <br>

                        <div class="multi-image-projects">
                            <img src="assets/extra-work/ethan-mollick.png" style="width: 50%; border: solid 5px; border-radius: 10px;">
                            <img src="assets/extra-work/washington-post.png" style="width: 50%; margin: 1em; border: solid 5px; border-radius: 10px;">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p> Determining the extent of the plagarism accusations, and the level of genAI usage in classrooms across the country helped me gauge the severity of a problem A.I content detectors could cause if the technology was deeply unreliable. This literature review helped reinforce the relevance of my research.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>More Literature Review:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The next stage of the research was more literature review, this time centered around the content detectors themselves and the technology behind them. 
Based on my previous literature review, I chose three detectors (GPTZero, Winston A.I, and Originality A.I) for their frequency of usage in higher education or their involvement in the plagiarism accusations. I was also planning on using chatGPT’s text classifier, but by the time I was conducting primary research, chatGPT removed it from their platform due to “low rates of accuracy.”

                        <br>
                        <p>Generic information about A.I detectors I gained from research papers or new articles, but information about each detector came from each company's web page directly. I collected information like pricing plans, type of algorithm it uses, self-reported accuracy ranges, and any self-reported limitations for each detector. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>The Webpage </h3>
                        <p>It was also at this time that I started to build the webpage that would host my visual essay. I wanted a color and font scheme that would be visually engaging and on theme for generative A.I/innovative technologies, and began designing in Figma.
                        </p>
                        <p>When developing my design, I referenced articles like the <a href="https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2/"> Pudding's “How to Make Dope Shit”</a> and the<a href="https://kawan.kontinentalist.com/tag/data-diaries/"> Kontentalist's “Data Diaries”</a>, to better understand and refine my storytelling skills, and to experiment with common data journalism coding practice. </p>
                        <p>It was the first time I had ever attempted “scrollyteling” (dynamically telling a story as the user scrolls through the webpage), so it was a steep learning curve. It took <strong>many</strong> iterations to get each div element to stick to the top of the DOM for the duration I wanted. At some point, I never wanted to see another sticky div again. In the spirit of data journalist Ilia Blinderman– I was intimated, I felt like it sucked, but I powered through.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Primary Research</h3>
                        <p>With my background research collected, and my webpage starting to take form, I began the most exciting part, the primary research. To tell how well the detectors perform, I would need to collect 3 types of text samples</p>
                        <ol class="hackathon-list">
                            <li style="font-weight: bold">100% AI generated</li>
                            <li style="font-weight: bold">50% AI generated and 50% human written</li>
                            <li style="font-weight: bold">100% human written</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To generate the AI text samples, I chose 3 popular LLM’s: chatGPT, Bard, and Claude.ai, to see how well the detectors fared against different AI.</p>
                        <p>There were many factors to consider when generating human writing. The detectors were known to perform better on longer pieces of English text, and students would normally encounter these detectors when writing analytical essays.</p>
                        <p>As such, I had 7 participants (all native English speakers, aged 18-25 and attending or recently graduated from higher education institutes) write 200 words to a prompt about a NYT article about P.E classes in China. To generate the 50% AI, 50% Human samples, I'd take the first 100 words of a human response and have each LLM generate the last 100.</p>
                        <p>The below image is the datasheet I used to track and record each set of responses, and how they held up again the detectors</p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="assets/extra-work/datasheet.png" style="width: 60%; align-self: center; border: solid 5px; border-radius: 10px";>
                        <br>
                        <p> With the data collected, now came time to visualize the data</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                        <p>I visualized the data using Matplotlib and Pandas with Google Colab as a notebook to run the code. Because there was data for 3 separate detectors, I chose to make 3 separate bar charts, as I didn’t want the information to be too cluttered to make sense of.</p>
                        <p>For each bar chart, I chose to have the human, combination, and AI graphs stacked vertically in order to be able to compare them directly. I also color coded the data in order for users to more easily identify them. </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="assets/extra-work/colab-code.png" style="width: 60%; align-self: center; border: solid 5px; border-radius: 10px";>
                        <br>
                        <p>After some trial and error in formatting, the visualizations were done. Once I added them to the visual essay, the project was complete!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>The Result</h3>
                        <p>This was probably one of the most thought-provoking projects I’ve had the pleasure of working on. It allowed me to take on so many roles, from being a web developer and A.I researcher, to an investigative journalist. It taught me so many lessons, and allowed me to test the limits of my abilities. I’m so grateful to everyone who made this possible, like Professor Melissa Webster, my mentor, my team members during the internship, and the research participants. It was an unforgettable experience! </p>
